	<h2>● Remove Pages/Change the Order<a name="remove">　</a></h2>
	<p>
		You can remove any pages or change the order of the pages with thumbnail view easily. To remove any pages from the document with thumbnail view, select pages you want to remove on thumbnail view, and press delete key. To change the order of pages, move pages with drag and drop on thumbnail view. Just after removing pages or changing the order of pages with thumbnail view, the page indexes aren't re-arranged. But when the document is re-open after saving, thumbnails will be re-numbered in order ascending.<BR>
	<img vspace="15px" border="1px" src = "image/ss11.tiff" width = "350" height = "124"><br>
	You can remove any pages by using the menu item <b>"PDF" → "Remove Pages by Specifying the Range..."</b>, too.<br>
	After selecting this menu item, the dialog sheet appears to specify the page range as shown in the upper figure. Input the page range you want to remove there, then click the button <b>"Remove Pages"</b>.
